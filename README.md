![main image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedamn-projects/quiz-app/master/images/startcard.png)

## Instructions
This project was created using ```yarn create vite``` and not ```npx create-react-app app-name```, hence there are some differences.
* After cloning, use ```yarn``` instead of ```npm install``` to install the dependencies.
* Use ```yarn dev``` instead of ```npm start``` to run the application
* Also when installing other packages, use ```yarn add <packagename>``` instead of ```npm install <packagename>```
*
